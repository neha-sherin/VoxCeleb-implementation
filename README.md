This is my implementation of paper - [VoxCeleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2017/Nagrani17/nagrani17.pdf), for speaker verification.

This code can be used to train the speaker verification model, and infer the metrics like EER and test-accuracy.

The VoxCeleb dataset for training can be downloaded from [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html).
